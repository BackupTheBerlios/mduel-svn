
NOTAS
=====

- Client installations should contain the JDK and the client side of the application .
This includes any remote interfaces because the client knows about these. It does
_not_ include RMI servers, skeletons or stubs. Servers and stubs do not belong at
clients at all; stubs can be downloaded if the system is set up correctly.
The client installation should also exclude any classes which you specifically want
to download to the client.
