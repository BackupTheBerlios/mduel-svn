        by Duncan Gill

- Marshmallow Duel will run under most conditions (requiring 215 KB free 
  conventional memory), but performs best on a 486 or better processor. 

- Feel free to distribute the shareware version to any of your friends.

- To receive the registered version, which includes grenades, nuke pucks,
  parachutes, boots, grappling hooks, warps, saveable stats, promotions,
  new combat armor, and retirement, simply send $15 to:

        Duncan Gill
        52 Morgan Road
        Hubbardston, MA 01452

  Include your e-mail or regular address, and I'll get the registered version
  out to you in a jiffy. Split the price with your friend -- it costs the 
  same as a night at the movies, but is probably more fun and certainly
  lasts longer!

- Enjoy the game!
